        <li>1 Red Bell Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Bunch Green Onions</li>
        <li>6 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>2 Sticks of Butter</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Cajun or Creole Seasoning</li> 
        <li>1/4 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup of Flour</li>
        <li>2 lbs of Small Shrimp</li>
        <li>2 Cups of Hot Water (Add more if desired)</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><b>Direction</b></p>
    <p>
        Start out by heating a Large Pot or Pan to a Low heat. <br>
        Chop the Onion, Celery, Red Bell Pepper, Green Bell Pepper, Green Onions, and Garlic. <br>
        Drop two Sticks of Butter into your pot and melt completely. <br>
        Add the chopped vegetables to the pot and raise burner to a medium heat. <br>
        Add the Cajun Seasoning, Salt, and Cayenne Pepper. <br>
        Sauté for about 30 minutes. <br>
        After 30 minuets of sautéing, push the vegetables to one side of the pot, add the 1/3 cup of flour and blend into the butter. Once the flour is mixed in well, stir everything altogether.  <br>
        Sauté for another 30-40 minutes, or until the flour becomes brown in color. Be very cautious during this time. If the heat seems a little high, lower it. You don’t want anything to burn to the bottom. <br>
        Around this time you want to begin cooking some rice. <br>
        When you start to see some brown color forming, begin heating 2 cups of water in the microwave. <br>
        Add a little bit of the hot water to the pot. <br>
        Stir, breaking up anything on the bottom, until it’s a creamy mixture. <br>
        Add the rest of the hot water to the pot. <br>
        Raise the heat to where you see a slight boil. <br>
        Cover, and then lower to a simmering heat. Cook for 30 minutes. Be sure to come back every 5 to 10 minutes and stir, breaking up anything trying to stick to the bottom.  <br>
        After 30 minutes, add the shrimp to the pot, and let simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes. <br>
        If you feel as though you would like a thinner gravy, just add a little more water. However, also taste it to see if you need more seasoning. <br>
        Enjoy Dat!
