# This project is an intro to learning full stack engineering through The Odin Project. I hopefully will demonstrate the use of paragraphs, headers, link, and images to this page. 

# I also would like to add onto this in the future to make a real recipe website that is self hosted, and potentially add a backend that can auto adjust recipe amounts for doubling, or tripling the recipe.
